I'm unable to determine the exact processor model name for the LINKSYS WRT54GV81 router from publicly available information. However, I can provide the following details:

Common Processors Used in Similar Models:

Broadcom BCM4712: This MIPS-based processor was widely used in Linksys routers of that era, and it's a likely candidate for the WRT54GV81.
Texas Instruments AR7: Another common processor found in Linksys routers of that time.
To Verify the Exact Processor:

Consult Official Documentation: Check the user manual or official specifications from Linksys' website or support resources.
Examine Physical Router: If you have physical access to the router, open it up and look for a model number on the processor chip itself.
Use Router Configuration Interface: If you can access the router's web-based configuration interface, it might display processor information under a section like "System Information" or "Status."
Contact Linksys Support: Reach out to Linksys customer support for accurate information.
Additional Considerations:

Firmware Version: The processor model might be listed in the router's firmware version information.
Third-Party Forums: Online forums or communities dedicated to Linksys routers might provide insights from other users.
Key Information to Provide for Accurate Help:

Full Model Number: Double-check the complete model number (WRT54GV81) for any variations.
Hardware Revision: If available, provide the hardware revision number, often found on a sticker on the router.
Firmware Version: Share the current firmware version running on the router.
I'm ready to assist further once you have more specific information.
